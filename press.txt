Geeks on a Farm is the startupers bootcamp where entrepreneurs from Germany, France and all over Europe come to network and have a great time together. The event is designed to help startupers progress on their projects through inspiring talks and workshops to help them to develop their skills. Because the event happens in the green countryside, it's also the time for entrepreneurs to network with like-minded people and take a step back to find new solutions to everyday problems

Last year’s edition has seen around 50 people: 25 French, 22 German, 1 Finnish, 1 Italian and 1 Belgian (yes, it sounds like a good joke), everybody was pleased of the outcome of the event: the quality of the talks, the quality of the food, the fantasy of the BBQ, the sportiveness of the football sequence and, of course, the friendly atmosphere during this truely international event.

This year event will be held in the Schloss Ortenberg, Germany on May 28 to 30, 2015. Tickets are already on sale beginning at 105,69€ until 17th of May, then it will be 148,09€.
