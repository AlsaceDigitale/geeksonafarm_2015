After a very first and very successful 2014 edition, we're back!

Last year's edition was a breeze. With around 50 people, 25 french, 22 german, 1 finnish, 1 italian and 1 belgian (yes, it sounds like a good joke), everybody was pleased witht the outcome of the event: the quality of the talks, the quality of the food, the fantasy of the BBQ, the sportiveness of the football sequence and, of course, the friendly atmosphere during this truely international event.

Stay tuned while we'll unveil the speakers for this year's edition during the coming weeks!
