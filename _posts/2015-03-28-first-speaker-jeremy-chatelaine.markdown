Jeremy Chatelaine will be with us at Geeks on a Farm 2015 and we're very glad
of it. Indeed, Jeremy is a long time friend of the Strasbourg's Startups
ecosystem. After being an attendee at [Startup Weekend
Strasbourg](http://www.up.co/communities/france/strasbourg/) a few times, he
bootstrapped [Quickmail.io](https://quickmail.io), becoming a specialist in the
art of cold mailing. He also was speaker at [Startup Weekend
Strasbourg](http://www.up.co/communities/france/strasbourg/) about how to
bootstrap your own company and reaching 10000$ of
[MRR](http://www.saasoptics.com/SaaS-opedia/saas-opedia/Monthly_Recurring_Revenue/Monthly_Recurring_Revenue.html).

Ever heard about growth hacking and the fact that in B2B "harvesting email" is
the key? Once you have a database of email addresses, what can you do with it?
That's why Jeremy will animate a workshop entitled ["The black art of cold
emails - Everything you need to know about cold emails to get an avalanche of
responses"](/speakers.html#jeremy-chatelaine).
