        <h3>How is it related to Geeks On A Plane and Geeks On A Beach?</h3>
        <p>
          Well, Geeks On A Plane and Geeks On A Beach are the inspirations for Geeks On A Farm. Chris met the Geeks On A Plane in Bangalore, India in 2011 and joined the Geeks On A Beach event on Boracay, Philippines, last year. He liked the format a lot and thought about hosting a similar event in the Black Forest region.
